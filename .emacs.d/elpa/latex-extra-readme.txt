latex-extra
===========

Defines extra commands and keys for LaTeX-mode. To activate (after
installing from melpa) just call

    (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'latex-extra-mode)

The additions of this package fall into the following three
categories:

1-Key Compilation
=================

Tired of hitting C-c C-c 4 times (latex, bibtex, latex, view) for
the document to compile? This defines a much needed command that does
*everything* at once, and even handles compilation errors!

  C-c C-a `latex/compile-commands-until-done'


Content Folding
===============

Similar to how org-mode hides and displays of subtrees, if you hit
<TAB> on a section header latex-extra will hide the contents of
that section for you. Hitting tab twice will expand it again.

Of course, the same goes for chapters, subsections, etc.

Navigation
==========

Five new keybindings are defined for navigating between
sections/chapters. These are meant to be intuitive to people familiar
with `org-mode'.

  C-c C-n `latex/next-section'
    Goes forward to the next section-like command in the buffer (\part,
    \chapter, \(sub)section, or \(sub)paragraph, whichever comes first).
  C-c C-u `latex/up-section'
    Goes backward to the previous section-like command containing this
    one. For instance, if you're inside a subsection it goes up to the
    section that contains it.
  C-c C-f `latex/next-section-same-level'
    Like next-section, except it skips anything that's "lower-level" then
    the current one. For instance, if you're inside a subsection it finds
    the next subsection (or higher), skipping any subsubsections or
    paragraphs.
  C-M-f `latex/forward-environment'
    Skip over the next environment, or exit the current one, whichever
    comes first.
  C-M-e `latex/end-of-environment'
    Exit the current environment, and skip over some whitespace
    afterwards. (Like `LaTeX-find-matching-end', but a little more useful.)

  C-M-b `latex/backward-environment'
  C-M-a `latex/beginning-of-environment'
  C-c C-p `latex/previous-section'
  C-c C-b `latex/previous-section-same-level'
    Same as above, but go backward.

Whitespace Handling
===================

`latex-extra.el' improves `auto-fill-mode' so that it only applies to
text, not equations. To use this improvement, just activate
`auto-fill-mode' as usual.

It also defines a new command:

  C-c C-q `latex/clean-fill-indent-environment'
    Completely cleans up the entire current environment. This involves:

    1. Removing extraneous spaces and blank lines.
    2. Filling text (and only text, not equations).
    3. Indenting everything.

Small User Experience Improvements
==================================

The buffer used to display LaTeX errors is typically a regular text
buffer in `fundamental-mode'. *latex-extra* switches it to
`special-mode' and adds some colors to the display.

Instructions:

INSTALLATION

If you install from melpa: just use (as described above)

    (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'latex-extra-mode)

If you install manually, first require it, then use the code above.
    (require 'latex-extra)
